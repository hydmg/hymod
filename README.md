cargo test --all-features --workspace
```

### Generating Coverage Locally

Install `cargo-llvm-cov`:

```bash
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
```

Generate an HTML coverage report:

```bash
cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace --html
```

The report will be generated in `./target/llvm-cov/html/index.html`.
